        "Academic publications are essential for tracking research productivity, promoting collaboration, and enhancing institutional visibility. However, the challenge of author name ambiguity makes it difficult for universities to accurately identify which publications belong to their faculty members. This is because multiple authors may share the same or similar names, affiliations may be missing or outdated, and authors may change institutions over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The University of Zambia (UNZA) needs a reliable and efficient way to identify publications authored by its faculty members across multiple academic databases. This will support accurate reporting of research output, strengthen the institutionâ€™s academic profile, and enable better decision-making in research management.\n",
        "\n",
        "The focus of this project is to develop a Data-driven classification model that can predict whether a given publication belongs to a UNZA faculty member. The system will analyze publication metadata such as author names, affiliations, email domains, co-author networks, and research topics to make this determination.\n",
